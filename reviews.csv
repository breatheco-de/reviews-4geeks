"The representative on the phone was giving me prices, even before we discussed the payment options, that don't match anything on the website. As a matter of fact, their price for the same online course varies from 3850-4600 if you pay upfront, whereas the representative was trying to sell me on the plan for 5300 telling me that he just applied some 1k discount to make it sound like a good deal. When I noticed when the website says and mentioned to him, on the next day he offered me to pay 4500. Overall, everything on their website is super confusing i.e. ""*Discount up to €1700. From €4600 instead of €6300"" or ""pay upfront and get a discount"", but turns out there is no additional discount. Anyhow, when I called him out on this later and tried to clarify how they come up with their prices, he avoided the question, got very rude and demanded that I pay up 6300 for the whole thing. 
On top of everything, this is a coding bootcamp, but they have failed to provide a safe payment system online and instead ask to make a weird wire transfer, or pay with crypto, which is super sketchy. They say you can pay by card, but that is actually not the case. These people just can't be trusted
","First, we are sorry for the treatment that the admissions staff may have provided. We have received similar reports from another applicant to the academy, and that is why we have already resolved the situation. We have an internal code of conduct, and we are committed to enforcing it. 
On the other hand, payment-related matters have always been a challenge in the education industry. The financing of education in the USA is the most significant challenge for any institution to overcome. 4Geeks makes a considerable effort to develop partnerships with multiple institutions to offer full and partial scholarships. These scholarships are allocated based on economic and territorial sectors. For example, at times, we receive funding to support single mothers in Miami through foundations like United Way or from a local government. 
Currently, we have a scholarship available in Texas. Additionally, there are financing providers such as Climb and Quotanda. Depending on the student's background, some providers are more flexible than others. This is why it is difficult for us to present a single payment option. In fact, we have tried to simplify this on our website with a table that clearly displays the pricing by region and the available scholarships.

"This Bootcamp is okay at best. I recently graduated from 4 Geeks. I feel like my cohort was cheated. There were times the instructor didn’t show up for a class or is running late. When he did decide to show up the material was rushed. 
After graduating we are supposed to have job support but the support I had so far is a big disappointment. I am constantly working around the different instructor's time even when I book a session in advance to make sure I can get help. I work a full-time job and to come home to learn program, study, and update my resume, and apply for a job places a large strain on me mentally. Due to studying hours on end and physically due to sitting in a chair for hours to make sure I don't feel like I wasted my money on a course that promises good results if you follow their instructions and do what is asked of you and more. I did learn but it was a hassle and some restless days. if you are new to programming I would find an alternative Coding Bootcamp there are a lot of them out there with good reviews. I went with this one since it was in Miami. I would be able to attend the campus if needed and it was affordable compared to the other options. But the saying is true you get what you paid for. There are a couple of good mentors like Tomás and Paolo. I greatly appreciate them because I would have given up a long time ago but the overall not so great which ruined my experience and feels like a total waste, unfortunately.
","We're really sorry to hear about your experience. At 4Geeks, we maintain an internal rating system for our mentors to ensure they provide the highest quality support. Our support system, the company Moat, is something we are very proud of, as many students have had an amazing experience with it—you can see this reflected in numerous positive reviews.

"My worst mistake was signing up for this course with no experience in Python or data science. They tell you that experience isn’t necessary, but it is the only way to be successful. I spent a lot of money that I can’t get back. I regret taking this course.
","Thank you for sharing your feedback Fuschia, and we're truly sorry to hear that your experience with our course didn't meet your expectations. We strive to design our programs to be accessible to beginners, including those without prior experience in Python or data science. While we've seen many students succeed with our approach, we understand that every learner's journey is unique, and factors like personal schedule and life-work-study balance can make the process challenging.

To support students starting from scratch, we offer several resources: unlimited lifetime human mentorship with as many sessions as you need, the option to retake the course for a fresh perspective, and 24/7 AI mentors to provide instant assistance whenever you're stuck. We're proud to offer this level of support, which sets us apart from many other bootcamps.

We'd love the opportunity to continue helping you achieve your career goals. If you're willing to stick with it, we're committed to sticking with you. Please feel free to reach out—we'd be happy to discuss how we can better support you moving forward. We hope you'll reconsider and let us assist you in making this a success.

"I'm very disappointed with this company. They make promises but struggle to keep them. One of the main reasons I joined was because I was told that after completing the course, I could retake it free of charge. Since I didn’t finish it, I’ve been trying to enroll again, but I’ve had no success. Marcelo hasn’t responded to my texts, and the number I used to call them appears to have blocked me—I have to use a different phone just to get through. If you're considering taking a course here, proceed with caution. I strongly recommend looking elsewhere
","Hi Brian, I don't really understand your claim. When you enrolled 4Geeks you tried, and the stopped. Then you asked to come back again, and you were welcome. And that happened more than 3 times in total. You were always welcome, invited and we supported your process. You never paid anything else beyond the first time. Nor were asked for re-entry fees (that normally applies in cases like this). A few weeks ago you sent an email, asking to come back, which we replied and you never got back to us again. Anyway, if you need help, please reach out to us at info@4geeksacademy.com, and as usual, we are happy to help!

"Worst costumer service line ever they laugh at me and didn’t even can respond an answer without an attitude. They didn’t seem insterest in joining more students into de program. Awfull experience. On the web side it says they had an Spanish program they claimed they don’t have such thing
","Hola, muchas gracias por escribirnos con tu más sincera opinión. Creemos que nuestro asesor del área de admisiones no logró comunicar de manera completa la oferta de nuestra academia. Contamos con programas en español únicamente en la sedes de Latinoamérica y en la de España. Adicionalmente tenemos un programa en inglés únicamente en la sede de USA - Miami. Es importante destacar que para estudiar en el programa de la sede de USA, es necesario contar con un nivel alto de inglés, ya que el contenidos que se imparte en el programa e técnico, lo que puede dificultar la comprensión y aprovechamiento óptimo del curso.
Nos encantaría que consideraras unirte a alguno de nuestros programas de Full Stack Development o Data Science. Para brindarte una asesoría más clara y detallada, permítenos contactarte nuevamente. Te pedimos muy amablemente que nos envíes un mensaje por interno para que nuestro CEO pueda contactarte personalmente para aclarar tus dudas y brindarte una atención más completa.

"Una de las peores academia! He estado alli y el CEO me dice lo siguiente: No pongas que eres de siria que los RRHH rechazaran tu solicitud. Solo buscan su imagen salga bien y no importa si el alumno trabajo o no. No lo recomiendo, solo quieren tener el credito de tu esfuerzo. Vaya personajes.","Hola Moha, gracias por compartir tu opinión. Sentimos mucho que tu experiencia no haya sido la que esperabas.

"What is the general consensus of 4Geeks academy? At the current moment I know nothing about the IT field. Truth be told I'm not even sure of what direction I should go. I recently discovered 4 geeks academy through an advertisement. The price is certainly ideal compared to a more traditional college path and with my inability to travel their online courses also sound ideal. I've seen a little of python and working with that sounds interesting. Because of that I was primarily looking at their machine learning and data scientist program. However I do have some questions and concerns. Would you recommend the machine learning program to someone who has forgotten anything more than basic math because they haven't used it in a long time? If not what programs would probably be better? How good are their programs at preparing someone for an job in the field if they have zero experience in the realm of IT? While they have an 86% hiring rate, is the program actually well recognized and reliable for getting me a job as oon as possible

"Coding bootcamp still worth it in 2025 market?
Hiring markets been tough and i’ve been unemployed for sometime now. Ive been looking into doing a coding bootcamp and switch career into tech. Stumbled across CareerFoundry, where they guarantee job placement after 6 months upon graduation or full refund. Sounds enticing but i just didnt want to spend 7k on a bootcamp for a guarantee paperwork job that pays crap","Hey, I went through 4Geeks Academy myself a while back, starting with zero coding experience. I chose it because it’s all about hands-on work, building actual projects, not just theory. The mentors were solid, knew their stuff, and kept me on track. The career support was a big deal too! resume help, interview prep, and it got me a remote job with a decent paycheck, way better than what I had before. They even taught us how to use AI tools, which matters a lot in 2025. Bootcamps like 4Geeks aren’t some passing fad; they exist because tech moves fast, and traditional schools can’t keep up with what employers need right now. They focus on practical skills you can use straight out of the gate, and that’s why they work. It’s not a cakewalk, you have to put in the effort... But it paid off for me!"
"AI Code Generation- Should I use it or stay away from it?
I know AI is all the rage right now and what not, but I've seen mixed signals on whether or not I should/could be using it to generate some of my code. Is that risky? Or is the potential time savings worth it?
My tech stack is MEAN stack (mongo, express, angular, node) btw. Obviously, I'm not talking about just using something like ChatGPT, which I know would be a security concern. Just curious if others are using it or not and if the benefits outweigh the risks?","AI’s moving fast in 2025, you should definitely consider using it to stay competitive! Companies are leaning into it for efficiency. For your MEAN stack work, AI tools like GitHub Copilot can crank out MongoDB queries or Express routes quick, saving you time. I’ve used them to jumpstart Angular components, and it’s a solid boost when you’re in a pinch.

The thing is that AI’s only helpful if you’ve got a strong coding base. It can spit out buggy or outdated code, and if you can’t spot the issues, you’re stuck. A bootcamp like 4Geeks Academy for example, teaches you how to implement AI tools properly; think generating code or building smart features while keeping your skills sharp. Old-school coding classes are falling behind, but you need that foundation to make AI work for you, not against you. My advice? Use AI to speed up your flow, but always double-check its work."

,"4Geeks Academy's cybersecurity bootcamp is a good pick for beginners. You learn hands-on stuff like securing networks through projects like threat detection tools, which employers notice. Also, you get Rigo, a virtual assistant 24/7, always giving you instant code feedback, which is great for learning fast. Another cool thing is that mentors are available even after you finish, so you’re not left hanging. 

They have something called Geekforce that connects you to 5,000+ hiring partners, helps with resumes and mock interviews, and offers a job guarantee (85% of grads get jobs in 100 days, which is great), often as web developers or data analysts. 

The academy also offers Full Stack Development, Data Science and ML. I went there myself, and let me tell you it's not easy, but they provide so many tools and support that it makes it a great BootCamp in my opinion. Hope this helps "
"Looking for coding bootcamps/courses with job guarantees. Suggestions?
Hey Reddit! I’m transitioning into tech and looking for online courses or bootcamps that offer job placement support after completion. Here’s my background:

Python (intermediate: OOP, Django, basic SQL)
Frontend (HTML/CSS, beginner JavaScript)

What I’m Looking For:
Job guarantee or money-back policy.
Programs with internships/hackathons (real-world projects).
Career support (portfolio reviews, resume help, interview prep).","Hey! I transitioned into tech not long ago and went through 4Geeks Academy, which might be worth checking out for you. They’ve got a job guarantee (or extended support/refund if it doesn’t work out), and their career support system, GeekFORCE, is next-level; resume workshops, mock interviews, and access to over 5,000 employer partners help grads secure roles like remote developers with strong salaries. You’ll work on real projects (including hackathons) and build a solid portfolio. I liked that they offer lifetime mentorship and support too!. Their full stack and data science tracks both cover Python and front-end pretty well, and they also teach how to use AI tools the right way. It’s not easy, but it’s legit."
"Part time coding bootcamp
Hi everyone,

I’m a senior data analyst at an established company in the US. I’m looking to transition into a software engineering role ideally within the same company.

I’m not just looking for help landing a job, I want to build the skills. What are the top 3 coding bootcamps you’d recommend for someone focused on learning and becoming a junior engineer?

I have been studying by myself, however, it’s challenging while having a full time job. Having a structured class would be better imo.

Thanks","I get it's hard working full-time and trying to pivot into software engineering. Self-study is great, but yeah, structure really makes a difference. I'd definitely recommend checking out 4Geeks Academy. It's designed for people working full-time, with both part-time and full-time options. What stood out for me was the strong focus on building real-world projects and mastering fundamentals (not just rushing to job placement). Their GeekFORCE career support is top-tier too, resume help, mock interviews, and access to 5,000+ hiring partners. Plus, you get lifetime mentorship, which is huge when you're juggling work and learning. The full stack program is solid for anyone aiming to move into a junior dev role. It’s not magic though; you still have to put in the time, but the structure and support really help keep you on track."
